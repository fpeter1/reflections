Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository if I work collaboratively with other people on a project.
But even for my own project this would make sense, as I currently work on two computers, desktop-PC
and laptop. With GitHub I could start using the PCs in the office.
