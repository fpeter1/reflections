Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository if I work collaboratively with other people on a project.
But even for my own project this would make sense, as I currently work on two computers, desktop-PC
and laptop. With GitHub I could start using the PCs in the office.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want full control over the state of the program I am working on. If Git automatically pulls changes, it might happen, that
the files on my computer change, though I don't want that.
