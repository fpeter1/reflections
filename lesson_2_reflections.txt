Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder is created. I assume there is a file that
keeps track of everything that happens in the folder.
git init is like hiring a git manager. first thing he does is telling
you what files you actually have.


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It seems to be something inbetween. It is different from the working directory as only a subset of all the files are part of it.
I can collect data in  the staging area and commit it when everything is set up properly.
